## Hey thereâ€”welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m **Lars Dornfeld**, a computational protein designer fascinated by **structural bioinformatics, de novo protein design, and machine-learning-powered biology**.  
After starting in the wet labâ€”engineering proteins and probing chemical biologyâ€”I shifted my focus to computational methods, building deep-learning models that accelerate discovery.

Explore my projects, papers, and code below. Thanks for stopping by!

:::{#hero-heading}
Iâ€™m a PhD student in the Biomolecular Design Group at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry (Munich), advised by **Prof. Lukas Milles** with **Prof. Karsten Borgwardt** guiding my deep-learning work.  
My research bridges high-throughput wet-lab automation with state-of-the-art neural networks to create novel, functional proteins from scratch.
